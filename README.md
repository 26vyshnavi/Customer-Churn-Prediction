**Customer Churn Prediction in Banking**

**Overview:-**

This repository contains the code and resources for predicting customer churn in the banking sector using machine learning techniques. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company, is a critical metric for businesses, especially in industries like banking where customer retention is key to long-term success.

**Project Structure:-**

**Data:** Contains the dataset (churn.csv) used for training and testing the models.
**Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks with the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis.
**Visualizations:** Contains visualizations generated during exploratory data analysis and model evaluation.
**Presentation:** Presentation slides summarizing the project findings, methodology, and recommendations.
**Scripts:** Python scripts for model deployment and serving the predictions.
**Requirements.txt:** File listing the required Python libraries and dependencies.

**Installation:-**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/26vyshnavi/customer-churn-prediction.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the Notebooks directory to explore the code and reproduce the results.
   
**Results:-**

The project achieves an accuracy of 86.4% with the Random Forest model, outperforming Logistic Regression and XGBoost. Feature importance analysis reveals age, balance, and credit score as significant predictors of churn. Recommendations include implementing targeted marketing strategies and enhancing customer service to improve retention rates.
