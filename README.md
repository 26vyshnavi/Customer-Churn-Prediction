Predicting Customer Churn in a Bank

 1. Introduction

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. In the banking industry, retaining customers is crucial for sustained growth and profitability. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict customer churn in a bank and identify factors influencing churn behavior.

 2. Objectives

Develop predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning.
Analyze key factors contributing to customer churn.
Provide actionable insights and recommendations for reducing churn rate and improving customer retention strategies.

 3. Dataset Overview

 Features:
 CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
 Age: Age of the customer.
 Num Of Products: Number of bank products used by the customer.
 Balance: Account balance.
 CreditScore: Credit score of the customer.
 EstimatedSalary: Estimated salary of the customer.
 Churn: Binary variable indicating churn status (1 for churned, 0 for retained).




 4. Methodology

 Data Preprocessing:
 Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
 Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
 Scaled numerical features to ensure uniformity in scale.

 Model Building:
 Implemented machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
 Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
 Trained the models on the training data and evaluated their performance on the testing data.

 Hyperparameter Tuning:
 Utilized techniques like grid search to optimize model hyperparameters.
 Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

 Model Evaluation:
 Assessed model performance using various evaluation metrics and techniques (e.g., confusion matrix, classification report).
 Compare the performance of different models to identify the most effective one.

 5. Results

 Model Performance:
 Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 0.811, F1-score = 0.77
 Random Forest: Accuracy = 0.8645, F1-score = 0.85
 XGBoost: Accuracy = 0.864, F1-score = 0.86

 Comparative Analysis:
 Random Forest and XGBoost outperformed Logistic Regression in terms of accuracy and F1-score.
 XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy and F1-score among the three models.

 Insights:
 Age, number of products, balance, credit score, and estimated salary were identified as key predictors of churn.
 Younger customers with fewer products and lower balances were more likely to churn.



 6. Discussion

 Challenges Faced:
 Handling imbalanced data and optimizing model performance.
 Interpretability of complex models like XGBoost.

 Recommendations:
 Implement targeted marketing strategies to retain high-risk customers.
 Enhance customer engagement through personalized offers and incentives.
 Improve product offerings and customer service to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.

 Future Directions:
 Explore advanced machine learning techniques such as deep learning and ensemble methods.
 Incorporate external data sources for more comprehensive analysis.
 Conduct longitudinal studies to track customer churn over time.

 7. Conclusion

In conclusion, predictive modeling techniques offer valuable insights into customer churn behavior in the banking industry. By accurately identifying at-risk customers and understanding the underlying factors driving churn, banks can proactively implement strategies to mitigate churn, improve customer retention, and enhance overall business performance.
